# Quantum-Computing-and-Quantum-Error-Correcting-Codes
This repository contains a laTex file which includes the prequisits as well as the implementation of the Quantum Algorithms and Quantum Error correcting codes. The prequisits consists of Basics of Linear Algebra and Basics of Quantum Computing, defining all the mathematics and background required to implement your first Quantum Algorithm.

Along with the document, I have also attached jupyter files which cover the implementations in python with and without Quantum Framework By IBM, Qiskit.
You can read the documentation of Qiskit here, https://qiskit.org/.
For better understanding you can create a log-in to IBM Q Experience, this lets you visualize and create your own Quantum Circuits and algorithms. Visit https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/login for the same.
